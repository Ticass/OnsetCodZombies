# Cod Zombies in onset
So I wanted to make a cod zombie styled gamemode for onset and I started doing it, if you wanna help just hmu 

## TO DO

* Arena

* AI System (For the zombies)

* MysteryBox

* revive system

* First Person Camera

* Buyable weapons on the walls

* Powerups (Juggernaut etc...)

## IN PROGRESS

* MysteryBox

## FINISHED

* Currency System (points)

* Fix the SetPlayerGun

## STABLE AND BETA BRANCHES

* The master branch will always be the latest **stable** branch with all the latest updates tested and bugfixed.

* The branch called **"dev"** will be exclusively reserved for developement.

* The branch called **"beta"** will be used for new untested updates and patches, it is not reccomended to use it unless you know what you are doing because it will frequently contain uncompleted, pointless or broken code. 

* The branch called **"Unstable"** will be the latest release of the gamemode "raw" what I mean by that is that the code works but it's not optimised. 


## AVAIALBLE FUNCTIONS AND COMMANDS

* AddPlayerMoney(player, amount) **/addmoney 200**

* SetPlayerMoney(player,amount) **/setmoney 200**

* ViewBalance(player, balance) **/balance**

* RemovePlayerMoney(player, amount) **/removemoney 200**

* BuyMysteryBox(player, price) **/box** **(Costs $950)**
